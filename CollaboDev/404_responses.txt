Have you tried looking under the bed
Have you tried looking in the fridge
Have you tried looking down the side of the sofa
Have you tried looking in the car
Have you tried looking under your desk
Have you tried looking in that random pot on your desk
Have you tried looking in the 1st draw down on the left
Have you tried looking in the reactor core
Have you tried looking behind the bookshelf
Have you tried looking on planet Edmunds
Have you tried looking in Groots room
Have you tried looking where Holston went after he left the silo
Did you leave it in the taxi
Did you leave it on the train
Did you leave it on the roof of your car
Did you leave it in the tray at airport security
Did you leave it on the plane
Did you leave it at the bar
Did you leave it at the cafe
Did you leave it at the office
Did you leave it at the playground
Did you leave it on the internet
Did you leave it over on the 503 page
Did a llama steal it
Did an eagle steal it
Did it get baked into a pastry
Did it get thrown out of the window
Did it run away with your spouse
Did it get sucked into a turbine
Did it get sent into hyperspace
Did decay into muons
Did get turned into a cyborg by the borg
Did you try consulting Deep Thought
Did it get derezzed on the grid
Did it get sucked into Gargantua
Have you tried consulting the tree of souls
Did it get chosen as a tribute in the reaping
Did it get sucked into a hydrorig
Have you reported it missing to the Tet
